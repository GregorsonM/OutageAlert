# OutageAlert
TRU Course: 		COMP 3450: Human-Computer Interaction Design
Development Team:	Nick, Taylor, Gregorson

## Description of the Problem
BC Hydro is the majority electrical utility provider in British Columbia. Presently, 
BC Hydro does not offer any alert service for its customers when power is lost at a home 
or business. Other electric utilities in North America do offer this service, such as EPCOR 
(Edmonton, AB) and Georgia Power. The core problem is that information about a power outage 
is not proactively distributed to electric utility customers who may need to take action to 
protect their property.


## Proposed Solution (Idea Description)
Our idea is a service that will scan BC Hydro's website for power outages and send a notification 
to our users that are affected. The solution will leverage the high adoption rate of smartphones 
and primarily send notifications by email and text message.


## Desired Outcome(s)
Benefits of project/product success:
* Users can receive prompt notification of a power outage affecting their property,
* Users can choose to take action to protect their assets,
* Users can have more certainty about power interruptions during inclement weather.

Product advantages over the competition:
* This service will not require users to purchase or install any hardware on their property, 
* Users will not be required to sign up for additional service contracts, such as a secondary wireless plan, in order to benefit from the service.

How project/product success is measured:
* Users are notified of a power outage affecting their home
* Users receive a notification within 5 minutes of the outage appearing on BCHydro.com.


## Target Audience
BC Hydro customers who are not at home when power is lost.


## User Story
I am a BC Hydro client. I lead a busy life and, despite COVID-19, I am still sometimes away from home for long periods. As someone who is dependent on having constant power to their home, in the case of a power outage I would need to know immediately so that I know to run home in the middle of the day to start up a generator.

After signing up for the service, I will enter my address and preferred means of contact into the system. 

The other day while I was at work I heard my phone go off, and upon checking it I saw a notification alerting me that the power at my house had gone out. After seeing the alert I quickly returned home and started up my generator.

Thanks to this service there was no damage caused by the power outage.
